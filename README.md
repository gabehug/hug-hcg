## Lessons Learned

I really appreciated going through the whole project cycle of a web design project. It was
extremely helpful for developing my confidence and workflow for future projects.

Specific Things Learned: 

- I used React Router to navigate between different components, each assigned a route with a specific address. This makes the single page site feel more dynamic as the page rendered is entirely different based on the route.

- I learned how to setup and handle input into a form with Formik and Yup verification. EmailJS then takes the form data and sends a formatted email to the clients inbox. 

- I used Media queries for the first time to create a fully responsive site.
